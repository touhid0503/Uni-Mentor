Project Proposal: A Website for Teacher-Student Interaction and Attendance Management



INTRODUCTION:
This project aims to create a website that will facilitate the interaction between teachers and students and enable the teachers to take and manage attendance online. The website will have the following features:
● A registration and login system, where teachers and students can create accounts with their IDs and passwords.
● An attendance system, where teachers can mark attendance for each class using manual input, and students can check their attendance records anytime also with percentages and marks.
● A database, where all the data related to the users, and attendance will be stored and retrieved.

GOALS & OBJECTIVE:
The solution that this project proposes is to create a website that will have the following functionalities:
● Registration and login system: The website will allow teachers and students to register and log in with their IDs and passwords. The website will also have a password recovery and reset option, and a user profile management option.
● Dashboard for teachers: The website will provide a dashboard for teachers, where they can create an attendance. The teachers will be able to:
○ Add, edit, and delete student lists.
○ View, download, and grade the submissions of students, and provide feedback and comments.
○ Create, edit, and delete announcements, and send them to students via email or SMS.
○ View and export reports on the attendance and performance of students.
● Dashboard for students: The website will provide a dashboard for students, where they can enroll in courses, submit assignments, take quizzes, and view announcements. The students will be able to:
○ View, download, and check the deadlines and grades.
○ View, download, and print announcements from teachers.
○ View and download their attendance and performance reports.
● Attendance system: The website will have an attendance system, where teachers can mark attendance for each class and students can check their attendance records anytime. The attendance system will:
○ Allow the teacher to manually mark the attendance of students who are absent or late.
○ Store and update the attendance data in the database and synchronize it with the teacher's and student's dashboards.
○ Send notifications and reminders to the students and teachers about the attendance status and issues.
● Database: The website will have a database, where all the data related to the users, courses, assignments, quizzes, and attendance will be stored and retrieved. The database will:
○ Use MySQL as the database management system and PHP as the server-side scripting language.
○ Follow the relational database model, and use tables, rows, and columns to organize the data.
○ Use primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes to ensure data integrity, consistency, and efficiency.
○ Use SQL queries to create, read, update, and delete data from the database.
○ Use PHP data objects (PDO) to connect and interact with the database.

Project Background:
The opportunity that this project offers is to create a website that will provide a one-stop solution for all the online learning needs of teachers and students. The website will:
● Enhance the quality and effectiveness of online teaching and learning.
● Improve the engagement between teachers and students.
● Simplify the attendance management and reporting process.
● Reduce the administrative workload and time loss for teachers and schools.
● Increase the accountability and transparency of teachers and students.

Deliverables:
The project will produce the following deliverables:
● A website that will have the registration and login system, the dashboard for teachers, the dashboard for students, the attendance system, and the database.
● A user manual that will explain how to use the website and its features.
● A technical documentation that will describe the website architecture, design, and implementation.
● A testing report that will show the results of the website testing and validation.
● A project report that will summarize the project objectives, background, solution, deliverables, timeline, and budget.
 
LANGUAGES & TOOLS:
The website will be developed using
1.    HTML
2.     CSS
3.     JavaScript
4.     PHP 
5.    MySQL
 
Timeline:
The project will follow the following timeline:
● Week 1: Project initiation and planning. The project manager will define the project scope, objectives, deliverables, resources, budget, and timeline. The project manager will also assign the roles and responsibilities to the project team members and communicate the project plan to the stakeholders.
● Week 2-4: Website development. The web developer and the web designer will work together to create the website and its features. The web developer will code the website functionalities and features using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. The web designer will design the website layout and appearance using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The web developer and the web designer will also use the Laravel framework to simplify and speed up the web development process.
● Week 5-6: Database creation and management. The database administrator will create and manage the database using MySQL. The database administrator will design the database schema, create the database tables, and populate the database with sample data. The database administrator will also use SQL queries to create, read, update, and delete data from the database. The database administrator will also use PHP data objects (PDO) to connect and interact with the database.
● Week 7-8: Website testing and validation. The tester will test and validate the website and its features using Selenium. The tester will perform functional testing, usability testing, performance testing, security testing, and compatibility testing. The tester will also identify and report any bugs or errors and suggest any improvements or enhancements. The web developer and the database administrator will fix any bugs or errors and implement any improvements or enhancements.
● Week 9-10: Website deployment and documentation.

Budget:
The project will have the following budget:
● Human resources: The project will pay the project team members $25 per hour, for a total of 480 hours (about 3 weeks). The total cost for human resources will be $12,000.
● Hardware resources: The project will rent a web server and a database server from a web hosting provider, for a monthly fee of $100. The project will also use a network connection from an internet service provider, for a monthly fee of $50. The total cost for hardware resources will be $450.
● Software resources: The project will use free and open-source software for the web browser, the text editor, the web development framework, the database management system, and the testing tool. The total cost for software resources will be $0.
